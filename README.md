# lmaocat

**lmaocat** is a simple, fast, and dependency-free Bash script that colorizes terminal output using your terminal's 16-color palette.
(Basically just lolcat - but with your terminal colors only.)

## Features

- Supports both **line-by-line** and **character-by-character** colorization
- Respects ANSI escape sequences (wonâ€™t corrupt output from tools like `sl`, `cbonsai`, `neofetch`, etc.)
- Randomized color order for each run
- Easily configurable group size (how many lines/chars per color)
- Works great with ASCII art, or shitpost pipelines

## Usage

```bash
lmaocat [OPTIONS]
```

It reads from standard input and colorizes the output.
